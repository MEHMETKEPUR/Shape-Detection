# Shape-Detection
Shape Detection with OpenCV

-Project Description-

This project is an OpenCV-Python-based application that detects five different geometric shapes using a real-time computer camera feed. The detected shapes include:

 *Triangle
 *Rectangle
 *Circle
 *Hexagon
 *Pentagon

The project also determines the perimeter, area, and color of the detected shapes using image processing techniques. Uses the masking method for accurate shape detection.

-Technologies Used-

 *Python
 *OpenCV (cv2)
 *NumPy
 *Visual Studio Code (as the development environment)


-How It Works-

The program captures frames from the computer camera.
It applies image processing techniques such as thresholding and contour detection.
Using the masking method, it detects the geometric shapes in the frame.
The detected shapes' perimeter, area, and color are determined and displayed on the screen.

-Usage-
Make sure arrange values right to detect shape color accurately.
Ensure a good contrast between shapes and the background for better accuracy.
Hold the shape in front of the camera for it to be detected.
The detected shape, its perimeter, area, and color information will be displayed in real-time.
